Well, I unofficially graduated. The Covid-19 pandemic formerly began in 2020. The pandemic changed everything, and as the world was looking for answers amidst extreme levels of uncertainty, there was one thing most of us could agree on. Staying a part. Six feet to be precise.</p><p name="334c" id="334c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In response to the outbreak, and an attempt to mitigate the spread of the virus, the country wide lockdown measures kept people indoors. No one knew how long the pandemic would last, in the moment it felt like it was never going to end.</p><p name="2573" id="2573" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During the height of the pandemic, the rules always seemed to shift and change. To wear a mask or to not wear a mask. No one could give you a straight answer. It also became apparent that my graduation ceremony was not going to happen in the foreseeable future. My university knew as much as I did when it came to the lockdown and when it would be lifted. We all wondered when it would be safe to sit next to a stranger.</p><p name="2f7d" id="2f7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Frankly, I forgot about it. My graduation ceremony that is. I never really waited on the day when I would celebrate my graduation. A part of this could be explained by my callous nature. I have always been indifferent and more often spaced out with reality. My post <a href="https://theignorant-views.medium.com/eh-being-indifferent-towards-life-6fa866398764" data-href="https://theignorant-views.medium.com/eh-being-indifferent-towards-life-6fa866398764" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">‘Being indifferent towards life’</a>, explores my nonchalant behaviour. However, I knew there was better reasoning behind my attitude.</p><p name="a26e" id="a26e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unlike many of my peers, friends, and family, I never felt graduating was a big deal. Sure I had just spent the last 18 years in the educational system, being taught what to think and how to act. And now, after nearly two decades, I had been let loose to the wild like a tamed animal.</p><h4 name="37d9" id="37d9" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">It’s just a funny looking hat</h4><p name="6cce" id="6cce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I did not care about my graduation. Not because I am ungrateful about having the opportunity to go to university. Far from it. I am a part of the first generation in my family to have gone to university. My parents are immigrants and I realise how important this event is to them.</p><p name="e179" id="e179" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My parents are overwhelmingly proud of me, and I am grateful to have such supportive parents. My mum worked hard to put me in this position, and my achievement is as much of a representation of my success as it is hers.</p><figure name="575f" id="575f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*A6_2YTuD_vayNBlLIgjpDQ.png" data-width="535" data-height="674" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*A6_2YTuD_vayNBlLIgjpDQ.png"></figure><p name="018b" id="018b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I did not care about my graduation because to me it represented a false narrative. The idea was that it was a key to new opportunities that were waiting for you. Having a degree is only the first step to a lifelong journey that will test you in more ways than a 3–4 year course could ever do. To me, a degree only showed so much of me, a thin slice of who I am.</p><p name="0249" id="0249" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I had my official graduation two years later, I did not feel any more accomplished than I had done in 2020. At that point, I was already working full-time as a teacher and eager to develop myself as a person.</p><h4 name="2195" id="2195" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Knowledge is Everything</h4><p name="347a" id="347a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I am not suggesting University is overrated. The experience of young independence, new connections with people, and being exposed to unique theoretical ideas is invaluable. My most valuable takeaway from University, and what I developed the most, was to clearly see a range of different perspectives. Understanding that two conflicting things can be true.</p><blockquote name="e376" id="e376" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows” — Sydney J. Harris</blockquote><p name="339c" id="339c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">I am a champion of education, it is the single most powerful tool in our arsenal. It is the seed that gives growth to all aspects of our lives. It is why I became a teacher. To give to those who need it the most. To provide them with the toolset to take control of their own lives.</p><p name="d2d7" id="d2d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Education can come to us in many ways. University is just a single vessel. A degree is not a sign that learning stops. Or even a sign of being an intelligent person. Instead, it is a note to ourselves to keep on exploring and challenging our truths.</p><p name="7d5d" id="7d5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At the end of my graduation ceremony, I knew there was so much more to learn. I could not sit idle as the moment was brief and fleeting. I could not help but fixate on what lies next.</p><figure name="90e8" id="90e8" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*jLhhfg8DklPKJ-qb9cI_mA.png" data-width="940" data-height="705" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jLhhfg8DklPKJ-qb9cI_mA.png"></figure></div></div></section>
