Well, at least that is what popular social media trends will want you to believe. The mainstream view on detoxes and cleanses involves drinking some sort of ‘green juice’, that has been made by blending a range of green stuff. As long as it is green, it can go in the blender. Green, green, green and more green.</p><p name="fdf8" id="fdf8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Spoiler alert: This post has nothing to do with blending green things into mush.</strong></p><p name="5bbd" id="5bbd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A music detox, or better yet a cleanse, entails not listening to music over for a while. Cancel the Spotify and Apple Music subscriptions. Scrap your overpriced Airpods. And delete any MP3 files from your devices. Once you have done that, you may begin the music detox that will lead you into a life of freedom.</p><h4 name="0b50" id="0b50" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">Haven’t done it? Pfft. Okay, how about this.</strong></h4><p name="dfae" id="dfae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Ask yourself why you need music in your life. Is it for escapism? Is it the mundaneness of the daily commute? Maybe you don’t feel your best, and you want some song you can relate to. Or it’s a Friday and being pumped is just what the doctor ordered. Whatever the reason music serves in your life, have you ever thought about the cost?</p><p name="b3bb" id="b3bb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When was the last time you sat through a journey without your ears plugged into a device, and not because you forgot to charge your headphones? You have forgotten what silence sounded like, and the sounds of nature.</p><p name="b3a0" id="b3a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I say this because I was once like you. Stricken by the desire to fill an empty silence. To be kept up to the latest charting tracks. I couldn’t eat, study, heck I couldn’t even sleep without playing a Lo-fi hip hop 24/7 live stream on YouTube! I was consumed by sound, and unaware I was being tortured by my need to have some sort of 808 beat in the background.</p><p name="0a39" id="0a39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And so I ask you to think again, at what cost are the sounds that you continually play? A festering plague that has deteriorated your relationship with being present. A clouded mind that is unable to think clearly because of pervasive sounds. Let yourself go of your compulsion, and be free of music!</p><figure name="7bf7" id="7bf7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*spcvXMXqsDCfN2hm" data-width="1260" data-height="716" alt="Someone breaking free of cuffs" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*spcvXMXqsDCfN2hm"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by Pixabay from Pexels: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/low-section-of-man-against-sky-247851/" data-href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/low-section-of-man-against-sky-247851/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.pexels.com/photo/low-section-of-man-against-sky-247851/</a></figcaption></figure><h4 name="2d0b" id="2d0b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">What a Music Detox Means</h4><p name="f2a8" id="f2a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Alright, I have exaggerated far too much and for too long. Music is not a festering plague. It is beautiful and plays a key role in our common human experience. Music can be peaceful and unite us. It can inspire and fill us with courage and excitement. Music, from the dawn of time, is something we can gather around.</p><p name="6f8d" id="6f8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I mean by a music detox is simply pausing constant consumption. I say this because of my experience. For a long time, I would not go by a single minute without listening to a song, to the point where I slept with earphones, playing some sad song I could curl up and cry to. I believe I needed music to be productive, to ignore the bustling of public transport and detach me from the world.</p><p name="5f6a" id="5f6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This worked for quite a while, and I was comfortable with it. However, there came a point where I just stopped. I found myself on my daily commute to work hearing the train tracks, the screeching of the brakes and the steps of people coming in and out of the carriage.</p><p name="83c6" id="83c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first day when I didn’t have my headphones, I instantly felt more connected to my surroundings. I felt more present and aware of my space. My thoughts were also more clear, and when studying I was not thinking about what song I wanted to play next.</p><p name="a802" id="a802" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whatever I was doing, I was able to engage in deep thought, whether that be writing, cleaning or working out. Especially working out, as the endorphins released during a workout in combination with an empty ear made me more conscious than ever.</p><figure name="0732" id="0732" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*DGws36RAfZYhDJ2KZkhBkg.png" data-width="781" data-height="1172" alt="A bench on a hill near the clouds" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DGws36RAfZYhDJ2KZkhBkg.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Photo by eberhard grossgasteiger from Pexels: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/lonely-bench-on-hill-in-woods-4406662/" data-href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/lonely-bench-on-hill-in-woods-4406662/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://www.pexels.com/photo/lonely-bench-on-hill-in-woods-4406662/</a></figcaption></figure><h4 name="5c9f" id="5c9f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Finding Value in a Music Cleanse</h4><p name="2bbe" id="2bbe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The single most powerful thing my music detox did was help aid my self-awareness and reflectiveness. I had more moments to stop and think. More chances to be mindful, thinking of the past, the present and the future.</p><p name="1096" id="1096" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is what my music detox did. It gave me more opportunities to think in a world where we are constantly overstimulated by technology.</p><p name="806e" id="806e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The beginning of this post gave the impression that a music detox is just the thing missing from your intoxicating life, and with it, all your problems will be solved. Let me tell you now, it will not. I still listen to music, regularly.</p><p name="cd4f" id="cd4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A music detox is something I do frequently for a couple of days. When I feel like I have a very clouded mind and am unable to write clearly, I will stop the song. When I feel out of place, and need recentering, I will stop the playlist. This idea of a music detox follows from my views on self-awareness.</p><p name="6666" id="6666" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We need to be aware of ourselves and identify what we need to make ourselves better. Whether that be music, social media, streaming, phone or internet detox, as time away from our regular routines is crucial for keeping a balance in our life.</p><figure name="83de" id="83de" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p graf--trailing"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eo813WVXqk8?feature=oembed" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><figcaption class="imageCaption">Meanwhile…</figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
